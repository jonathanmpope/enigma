# Self Eval

## Functionality

My Enigma project meets expectations. It can encrypt, decrypt, and all command line functions work properly. It can deal with things like numbers, symbols, and upper case letters without losing functionality. The decrypt method will autogenerate a date and key if none is provided. The key will maintain leading zeros if a lower number is generated.

## Object Oriented Programming

My program is broken down into 5 classes, each with a distinct set of responsibilities. All classes are less than 100 lines of code and interact throughout the Enigma program. 

## Ruby Conventions and Mechanics

My code is easy to read and understand. All methods are less than 7 lines long. Helper methods are used to break up longer chains of logic, making the code easier to read and understand. Spacing and indentation is consistent throughout all classes and spec files. I use a hash to assign letters in the message to their index position. Both are used in my encryption and decryption logic.

## Test Driven Development

All methods are both unit and integration tested. Coverage is 100%. I used mocks and stubs in a few instances as well as a 'mock' file to test my file reading method. All tests were written prior to code implementation.
